## Introduction

The VeChain DAppKit is a TypeScript library that facilitates seamless interaction between VeChain wallets (VeWorld, sync2)
and dApps, enhancing user experience and developer convenience. Please refer to [VeChain Docs](https://docs.vechain.org/developer-resources/sdks-and-providers/dapp-kit) for full documentation and usage.

## Why ?

- Allow easy interaction with all wallets.
- Currently, Connex only plays nice with Sync / Sync2
- Enable a better UX for users

## Key features

1. **Wallet Connectivity**: Key components that handle interaction with VeWorld and Sync 2.

2. **Customizable UI**: Ability to totally customize the UI of components.

3. **User Experience**: Consistent experience with Ethereum and other chains.

4. **Developer friendly**: Easy to adopt with proper documentation.

## Branching Strategy

Welcome to our project! Here's an overview of our branching strategy.

---

### Branch Types

- **main**: The main branch represents the production-ready code. Only stable and tested features should be merged into
  this branch. Once ready for publishing, a new tag should be created from this branch.

---

## Setting up for local development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.17
- Yarn >= 1.22.10

### Install & build dependencies

```bash
yarn install:all
```

### Run in Dev Mode

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Useful scripts

### Test

```bash
yarn test
```

### Clean project

```bash
yarn clean
```

### Purge project

- Runs yarn clean and removes all node_modules

```bash
yarn purge
```

### Install yarn packages

```bash
yarn
```

### Build dependencies

```bash
yarn build:deps
```

### Build release

```bash
yarn build
```

---

### E2E Testing

We utilize Cucumber.js with Selenium for end-to-end (E2E) testing. To conduct these tests, you'll require the ChromeDriver. Here's how to install it:

**On Mac:**

```shell
brew install chromedriver
cd "$(dirname "$(which chromedriver)")"
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine chromedriver
```

Once installed, you can run tests in the browser using:

```bash
yarn test:e2e
```

Alternatively, you can run headless tests directly in the console using:

```bash
yarn test:e2e:headless
```

---

## Further Documentation & Usage

- Please refer to [VeChain Docs](https://docs.vechain.org/developer-resources/sdks-and-providers) for more information
  on how to use the library.

---

## Publishing

```bash
# prepare the release, this will check out the release branch, install dependencies, build packages, test and update the package versions
yarn prepare:release X.Y.Z
```

Create the PR for the release branch `vX.Y.Z`.

When the PR is merged, create the release on github called `X.Y.Z`, it will automatically publish the packages to npm.
